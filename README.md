## Project Title
Famous Painting Image Replicator with Genetic Algorithm (DEAP)  and Painter Identifier with Deep Learning Model (Keras) Program 🖌️

## About Our Project ⛅

The image replication component employs the DEAP framework, implementing a genetic algorithm to iteratively generate paintings resembling famous artworks. On the other hand, the painter identifier utilizes the Keras deep learning framework to construct a neural network model capable of recognizing and attributing paintings to specific artists. This dual-functionality program offers a unique blend of genetic algorithms and deep learning, providing users with the ability to both replicate iconic artworks and identify the artists behind diverse paintings.
