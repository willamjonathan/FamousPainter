# MUSE - Famous Painting Image Reconstuctor with Genetic Algorithm (DEAP)  and Painter Identifier with Deep Learning Model (Keras) Program üß†üíªüñåÔ∏è
MUSE is a program designed with 2 main features, an image reconstructor and a painter identifier. It is designed to assist art enthusiasts and general users in decomposing pictures and reconstruct it step by step and assisting people in identifying the painter behind a famous painting. From identifying the painter behind a painting, users can explore the artist's works for their artstyles, fulfill their curiosity, or just to appreciate them. Moreover, the image reconstructor allows users to see the decomposition to full reconstruction process, done by a genetic algorithm through a natural selection of the fittest generation, which can aid in their art journey. The image reconstructor utilizes the DEAP framework for genetic algorithm while the painter identifier uses a Tensorflow Keras (CNN) based model for the predictions.
